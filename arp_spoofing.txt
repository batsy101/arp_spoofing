-> The code sends spoofed arp response packets

-> It sends two types of response packets
   1) A packet to the router claiming that attackers mac address is the destination mac address for the victim's IP address.
   2) Similar process in second response tells the victim that we are the router.
   
The packets are sent continously untill you force quit using ctrl+c
